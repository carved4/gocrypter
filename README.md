# gocrypter - an implementation of https://github.com/Amaop/Rust-Crypter in golang + cpp with ChaCha20 instead of AES encryption + a custom PE loader to execute in memory 
## Important Notice

This repository previously included a compiled test binary (`runpe.exe`) demonstrating successful in-memory execution of a benign payload. That file will be removed shortly to ensure full compliance with GitHub's policies and to prevent misuse.

**This project contains no functional malware or droppers.** All tooling is provided strictly as source code for research, red teaming, and educational purposes only.

If you're viewing this before the file is removed, please note:
- The payload is a harmless Go binary that writes `"it worked!"` to disk
- It is not designed for malicious use and will be removed to avoid confusion or abuse

Check back shortly for the updated version.
This project contains two components:

1. **crypt** - A tool to encrypt a preferably golang executable file using ChaCha20, and turn it into two parts
    - a - the encrypted_input.bin (which are the encrypted bytes of the target executable)
    - b - the key.txt which is used in the stub build to decrypt the bytes and execute in memory
2. **stub** - a golang binary that embeds, decrypts, and executes the encrypted file directly in memory using a custom implementation of PE exec with process hollowing and a custom PE loader, which is also embedded in the stub binary to perform the
ACTUAL in memory execution of the encrypted file. (no go memexec bullshit dropping to /temp)

## NOTE: Limitations & Requirements

**[+] Relocations are _not_ handled currently, execution relies on memory alignment and luck**

To avoid crashes and maximize compatibility:

- Your payload **should be a statically linked binary**, preferably written in **Go** or **Rust**
- If the process you're hollowing has **full ASLR enabled** (e.g., `/DYNAMICBASE` flag set), this will likely **fail**
  - Most Microsoft-signed binaries (e.g., `OneDrive.exe`, `notepad.exe`) often have partial ASLR, but **donâ€™t count on it**
- Avoid:
  - Using **CGo** (in Go projects)
  - Direct **WinAPI calls** (especially in Rust,they're hard to avoid and expand your import table)
- Ideally, structure your binary to rely **only on `kernel32.dll`**
- For best results:
  - **Hollow a suspended process you spawned yourself**, so you control the memory layout and avoid base address collisions
- If you need a more robust alternative that doesn't execute strictly in memory but handles relocations and imports, try my original [`gocrypter`](https://github.com/carved4/gocrypter) that uses `go-memexec` 

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository 
2. cd gocrypter
3. Put your target executable in gocrypter/crypt
4. In a shell, cd into gocrypter/crypt
5. To use crypter: `go run main.go example.exe` (whatever the name of the binary you put in crypt, obviously)
6. Then, the files encrypted_Input.bin and key.txt will be created in the gocrypter/stub directory
7. cd into gocrypter/stub
8. `bash build-all.sh` 
9. Done!

## Features

- Encryption/Decryption: ChaCha20 stream cipher
- Memory Execution: stub/cpp and internal/runpe/runpe.go
- The encrypted file and key are embedded in the stub binary using Go's embed package

## Security Considerations

This is a basic implementation and may not be suitable for production use without additional OPSEC measures.
(obviously do not use this outside of a lab environment or an authorized redteam engagement, I am not responsible for your actions)

- The key is stored in plaintext within the stub binary
(implementing secure key derivation soon)
- No anti-debugging or VM detection mechanisms are implemented
(have a package for this but may not share until further testing)
## Example Usage with Go Binary that writes "it worked" to current dir
